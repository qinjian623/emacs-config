This minor mode provides syntax highlighting of numeric literals
in source code, like what many editors provide by default.

To enable: call `number-font-lock-mode'.

It tries to be customizable: it should be easy to add or redefine
what exactly consitutes a "number" in given major mode. See
`number-font-lock-modelist'.
